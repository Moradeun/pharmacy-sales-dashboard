## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Managing sales and inventory in a **community pharmacy** involves daily challenges:  
- Preventing **drug expiry losses**  
- Maintaining the right **stock levels**  
- Monitoring **sales and profitability**  
- Understanding **patient purchasing patterns**  

As a pharmacist, I often faced these issues firsthand. To address them, I built this Power BI dashboard to convert pharmacy data into actionable insights. The dashboard enables better decision-making, optimized stock management, and improved financial performance.


## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Community pharmacies often rely on manual record-keeping or basic reporting, which makes it difficult to:
- Track **which drugs sell the most**  
- Identify **near-expiry products** that may cause financial loss  
- Monitor **profit margins across drug categories**  
- Understand **patient behavior and visit frequency**  

This project solves these challenges by creating a **centralized analytical dashboard** for pharmacy operations.
