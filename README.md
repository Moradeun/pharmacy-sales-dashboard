## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Managing sales and inventory in a **community pharmacy** involves daily challenges:  
- Preventing **drug expiry losses**  
- Maintaining the right **stock levels**  
- Monitoring **sales and profitability**  
- Understanding **patient purchasing patterns**  

As a **pharmacist**, I often faced these issues firsthand. To address them, I built this **Power BI dashboard** to convert pharmacy data into **actionable insights**.  
The dashboard enables **better decision-making, optimized stock management, and improved financial performance**.
